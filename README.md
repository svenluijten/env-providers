A more finetuned way of managing your service providers in Laravel. This package
allows you to configure the environment certain service providers and
aliases are loaded in.

## Installation
Via [composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```bash
$ composer require sven/env-providers
```

Or add the package to your dependencies in `composer.json` and run
`composer update` to download the package:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "sven/env-providers": "^4.0"
    }
}
```

Next, add the `ServiceProvider` to your `providers` array in `config/app.php`:

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Sven\EnvProviders\ServiceProvider::class,
];
```

## Usage
You must publish this package's configuration file for it to work properly. To
do so, run the following command:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sven\EnvProviders\ServiceProvider"
```

After that, you should see the file `config/providers.php`. In the created
configuration file you can see 2 pre-defined provider groups that will help you
set up what providers and aliases should be loaded when the application is in any
of the configured environments.

### Environments
In the `environments` array you can define what are known as "environment aliases".
For example, if you use more than one name for `local` development (eg. `dev`,
`development`, and `local`), you can alias all of these to _one_ name to use in
this package's configuration.

**Note**: You can set your application's environment in either `config/app.php`
under `env` or via your `.env` file. If you want to manage your `.env` file via
`php artisan`, you can check out [`sven/flex-env`](https://git.io/flex).

### Groups
The `groups` key in the configration is used to load in service providers and
aliases (also know as facades) in one of the previously defined environments.
You can use `*` as a wildcard here to _always_ load that group, regardless of the
application's environment.

#### Providers
The `providers` array is where you can put the providers you want to have loaded
in the defined environment. This should be pretty straight forward as it is similar
to how you would register service providers in `config/app.php`.

#### Aliases
In the `aliases` array you may define all your aliases (facades). As with the
providers, this is the same as how you would register aliases in the default 
`config/app.php` configuration file.

### Example

```php
return [
    'environments' => [
        'dev' => ['local', 'development', 'dev'],
        'prod' => ['production'],
    ],
    
    'groups' => [
        'dev' => [
            'providers' => [
                Sven\ArtisanView\ArtisanViewServiceProvider::class,
                Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider::class,
            ],
            'aliases' => [
                'Debugbar' => Barryvdh\Debugbar\Facade::class,
            ],
        ],
        'prod' => [
            'providers' => [ /* ... */ ],
            'aliases' => [ /* ... */ ],
        ],
        '*' => [
            'providers' => [ /* ... */ ],
            'aliases' => [ /* ... */ ],
        ],
    ],
    
],
```

Notice how we're only loading the Debugbar ServiceProvider and facade when our
application's environment is either `local`, `development`, or `dev`. This means
we can't use the `Debugbar` facade in our project when the environment doesn't
match any of those.
